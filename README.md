Examples on how to use Polymer 0.9.

I've created this repository as an addition to my blog on Polymer on http://sanderrossel.com. The specific blog can be found on http://sanderrossel.com/polymer-for-reusable-web-components/.

It simply contains some examples on how to use Polymer. Web server (e.g. Apache) necessary to run the examples.
